 Group of non Corporal beings That call themselves Strand Weavers set out to stop one of their own from changing and twisting time for control and power. They search for threads of time that have been hidden from them to help them fight against the tyranny of the "Temporal Supremacy".  
 
 After a long battle with K'rez they're violently transported into the In-between grasping at the weave they find a strand that leads them to a girl, Anya, who does not know it yet, but her past, present and future is about to change.
