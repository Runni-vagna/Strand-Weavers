**Personality**

- **Core Traits:** Confident, extroverted, relentlessly optimistic, highly intelligent.

- **Speech Patterns:** Speaks rapidly, her words almost tumbling over each other with excitement, even when alone. This reveals her longing for conversation and the life she feels is passing her by.

**Backstory**

- **Family:** Close-knit and deeply caring, Anya's parents struggle to find the balance between providing support and allowing her the independence she craves. Her father, Senator Thomas Thorne, leads a public life causing frequent friction and a hint of resentment from Anya. Her grandfather, William, was a local historian and the source of many captivating stories of their shared lineage until his recent debilitating health issues.
- **Seizures:**
    
    - **Frequency:** Occur several times a week, sometimes clustered closely together.
    - **Severity:** Varies from brief moments of absence to episodes that leave her exhausted and disoriented.
    - **Glimpses:** Vivid and terrifying. Fragments of battles, explosions, and landscapes in stark colors. There's a haunting melody that often lingers afterward.
    
- **Grandfather's Stories:** A mix of genuine family history and tales infused with cryptic references to beings woven into the fabric of time. William, unaware of the truth within the tales, saw it as simply keeping his granddaughter entertained.
- **Reading Choices:** Hard sci-fi dominates her bookshelf, worlds filled with space travel and daring rebellions – a stark contrast to her reality.

**Goals & Motivation**

- **Primary Desire:** To break free from her isolated existence and embark on the real-life adventures she has only dreamt about.
- **The Weavers:** Drawn to her extraordinary temporal sight, they make contact at a particularly vulnerable moment for Anya. Their initial appearance is jarring, yet Anya instinctively understands they represent the escape she desires.
- **Spatiotemporal Sync:** Initially chaotic and overwhelming, Anya's control over her "sync" strengthens in direct relation to her bond with the Weavers. However, with multiple linked Weavers, conflicting influences sometimes leave Anya reeling.
- **Temporal Shifts:** These unsettling visions aren't merely glimpses of possible futures, but warnings of imminent threats across timelines.

**Additional Details**

- **Love Interest:** Xan, a fellow Student one of Anya's most loyal friends. Their bond deepens after her transformation, becoming complicated by both her new reality and his desire to protect her.
- **The Antagonist:** A splinter faction of Weavers driven by a lust for power seeks to exploit Anya's abilities, leading to conflict that draws in her father's political world. This adds a complex layer of personal stakes.
