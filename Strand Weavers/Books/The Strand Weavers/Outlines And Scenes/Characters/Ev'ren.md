#### Physical Description

A Strand Weaver, a non corporal group of beings that exist in the spaces between time, the in-between. Most don't even realize that they are even alive, just sitting and watching with no interaction. Until another show them how. Eventually they figure out that they can not observe creatures and intelligent beings such as humans, they can interact in symbiotic relationship, usually with just a suggestion. But over the eons, many have found that when galactic time shift events happen such as a Super nova or when when black holes collide. A fracture in space time happens and can ripple through the strands that they are connected to. Sometimes leaving a piece of themselves attached to the host. It is quite common that heavers tend to follow family lineages and sync with them as they progress through time, often leaving these peaces over generations. these build in the DNA or other building blocks that make up different species, creating a unknowing powerful being.
