# Prologue

Before there was light, before the first star ignited and the planets spun into being, there was only the Weave. An infinite tapestry of moments, stretching from the unfathomable past to the unknowable future. It was not woven of thread, nor painted in color, but existed as pure potential; every path, every choice, every echo of what might be.

In the vast stillness, consciousness flickered. We, the Strand Weavers, awoke. We had no bodies, no voices to cry out in the cosmic silence. We were barely wisps, slivers of awareness adrift in the endless potential of time.

And then, we saw them. The threads. Shimmering strands of vibrant energy, each representing a life, a world, a choice made. Our essence surged towards them, drawn by an insatiable curiosity.

It was clumsy at first. Our touch against a thread would send ripples cascading forth, causing unanticipated shifts and bends. A tiny alteration to a mortal's decision could set in motion a galaxy-altering cascade. It became a delicate dance, learning to interact without undue disruption.

Soon, we found that we could do more than merely observe. We discovered the ability to slide along a thread, a sliver of our consciousness inhabiting a single moment, witnessing it firsthand. Our presence was no more than a shadow amidst the brilliance of mortal action, a whisper upon the wind.

Some among us yearned for more. We saw patterns in the Weave, places where the strands snarled and knotted, where chaos threatened to overtake order. We learned to offer the barest of nudges, not forcing any outcome, but offering a gentle suggestion, the chance to unravel a tangle.

It was in these moments of connection that we became more. Interacting with those caught in the threads of time, we felt echoes of their emotions, fragments of their dreams. We began to understand the beauty and sorrow woven into the fabric of existence. Some of us forged powerful bonds, becoming silent guardians, helping chosen mortals navigate the currents of their own lifespans.

Yet, the Weave is vast and unyielding. The potential for harm will always exist, not just from external forces, but from those who would seek to twist the strands to their own will. Our own kind can be seduced by the lure of manipulation, seeking control rather than balance.

This is why we watch, why we nudge, and if necessary, why we fight. For the threads of time are more precious than any gem; they are the stories of every soul, the foundation upon which the universe rests.
